\section{Introduction}

This report discusses biomass pyrolysis fluidized bed reactor modeling activities for the Feedstock-Conversion Interface Consortium (FCIC) project. Model parameters are based on the NREL 2FBR biomass fast pyrolysis system which is comprised of a two-inch diameter bubbling fluidized bed (BFB) reactor. Experiment data, apparatus information, and material data are provided by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), and the Idaho National Laboratory (INL). Model development and associated results are provided by Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL).
